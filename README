Albatross!

If you don't know what this is, chances are you don't need it.

Albatross (this iteration of it, anyways) is a Python script that monitors and reports malformed links on endoftheinter.net. The checks it performs (will) include:

1. Checks for the presence of popular [TAG]s in the link title, and ensures that link categories are set appropriately
2. Checks to see if links on popular upload sites are still active.

If one of the above checks fails, Albatross will automatically report the link to be handled by a link moderator.

Albatross is licensed under the WTFPL. Do what you want with it!

To get started, simply install Python, download albatross, and run the following commands: (on a Linux machine, at least):
python albatross [--no-report] USERNAME PASSWORD START_LINKID END_LINKID
